## Contributors and responsibilities

- **Tobias Andersson** – Fullstack developer

# Project description

This project is meant to create a chat application for those that dont want old messages to linger longer then they should.

## Functionality

Application:

- Simple easy to use user interface for users to start chatting quickly.

## Goal

- Implement a easy to use chat application where old messages are removed.

## Development

They project has been developed in the "examensarbete" course in folkuniviversitetet göteborg's framework for Javascript-developers

## Uninplemented functionalities and notes

- Users should also get a sidebar if they currently are looking for friends, that also means they will pop up as suggestions in a sidebar for other users.
- Create chat shouldn't go by usersname (unless youve consented to appear in other users feeds) since then you can add everybody directly which can be pretty annoying for the recipient, the goal is to add friend ID's so you can copy and paste it to a friend.
